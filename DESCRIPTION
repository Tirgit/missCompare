Description: The missCompare package offers a convenient pipeline to test and compare various missing data
  imputation algorithms on simulated and real data. The central assumption behind missCompare is that structurally
  different datasets (e.g. larger datasets with a large number of correlated variables vs. smaller datasets
  with non correlated variables) will benefit differently from different missing data imputation algorithms.
  missCompare takes measurements of your dataset and sets up a sandbox to try a curated list of standard and 
  sophisticated missing data imputation algorithms and compare them assuming custom missingness patterns.
  missCompare will also impute your real-life dataset for you after the selection of the best performing algorithm
  in the simulations. The package also provides various post-imputation diagnostics and visualizations to help you 
  assess imputation performance.
