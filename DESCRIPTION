Description: The missCompare package offers a convenient pipeline to test and compare various missing data
  imputation algoritms on simulated data. The central assumption behind missCompare is that structurally
  different datasets (e.g. larger datasets with a large number of correlated variables vs. smaller datasets
  with non correlated variables) will benefit differently from different missing data imputation algorithms.
  missCompare takes measurements of your dataset and sets up a sandbox to try a curated list of standard and 
  sophisticated missing data imputation algorithms and compare them assuming custom set missingess patterns.
  missCompare WILL NOT impute your dataset for you. However, missCompare WILL give a comparative analysis of algorithms 
  and offer a report with the best performing algorithms assuming various missing data patterns and publication 
  ready visualizations to help you better understand missing data in your dataset.
